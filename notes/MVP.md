# MVP

- Source material: Little Prince
- Layout: Plaintext
- Still want to highlight key words
- Basic tokenizer
    - Basic word swap selector
        - this might want lists of conjugations?
- Basic semantic mapping
    - Basic grammar swap selector
- First instance of word has a grammar highlight (this can be nonfunctional) - can also revisit at any time?
- does it make sense to have color-coded language? I’m not sure how you would make this look not insane? quizas light highlights?
    - for bastardized words we can do a sort of **redblue** thing
    - new words are always bold-blue
- eventually you’ll have to switch from one language being highlighted to the other. Maybe when >50% of the words are one language, the other language is in highlights instead?
- 
    
    

## Future

- Idiomatics get filtered out first, maybe, and get their own notes?
