These examples demonstrate how you can access and manipulate token mappings using the Hugging Face Tokenizers library and OpenNMT-py. Keep in mind that the specific syntax and functionality may vary depending on the library and version you are using.
It's important to note that manipulating token mappings directly can affect the quality and coherence of the generated translations, especially if the modifications are not linguistically coherent. Therefore, it's recommended to use these manipulation techniques with caution and consider the impact on the overall translation quality.
