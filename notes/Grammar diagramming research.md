# Grammar diagramming research

## main questions
- Feed to LLM via API or use older system?
- 


## Research to do

- Grammar frequency study (e.g. is it better to do infinitives first?)
    - Can just do this experimentally
    - Might be easier to just do the easy transitions first: *-tion/-cion*, *-ly/-mente*
- Does conjugation tokenization improve LLM comprehension for cross/lingual purposes?
-
