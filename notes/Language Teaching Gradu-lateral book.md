# Language Teaching Gradu-lateral book

## Motivation

[[Scott's original idea]]

## My modifications to Scott’s idea:

- Want to start with switchovers immediately? Like - grammar - “to be - ser.” Just do that immediately? 1 grammar note per section.
    - Probably actually the first is THE >> EL/LA LOS/LAS
- I would expect that it’d be hopeless to get through the whole book in one go. Most of the book will remain untranslated until the end
- 
- Probably you’d want to tokenize the whole thing? And highlight the first replacement instance of each token?
- Editing tool - want to be able to quickly tag through the work
- Want to source things that have existing bilingual versions, e.g. The Little Prince
- Might need some underlying grammar engine for programmatically mapping the bilingual versions to each other
- Noting that this project doesn’t really scale - you do it with one book, you’re sorta stuck - what level do you start the next book at?
    
    
- So for learning languages, this doesn’t super help with spoken, right? But maybe you could make it work with some sort of speech synth? Like your tia’s spanglish
- Pain points for English>>Spanish
    - Masculine/feminine
    - Ser/estar

## Austin’s advice

- MVP should almost certainly be static, not dynamic or interactive.
- Try doing the first few chapters - try doing the first chapter manually to see what will be tough
- Probably not that strong a language idea - otherwise they’d be doing it all over the place

## Extensions

- Note that you could in fact build a whole suite around this. Like, you could have the teacher choose which concepts to introduce where in the book? (Seems like somewhat annoying even with the best tooling)
