Mr. Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock Holmes Mr.
Xié luò kè · fú ěr mó sī xiān shēng
歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table.
Sherlock Holmes Mr. sat at table breakfast, he except often all-night not sleep besides, morning always was get-up very late.
Xié luò kè · fú ěr mó sī xiān shēng zuò zài zhuō páng zǎo cān, tā chú le shí cháng chè yè bù mián zhī wài, zǎo chén zǒng shì qǐ dé hěn wǎn de.
歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生坐在桌旁早餐，他除了时常彻夜不眠之外，早晨总是起得很晚的。
I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before.
I stood at fireplace front small rug on, picked up last night that guest forgot cane.
Wǒ zhàn zài bì lú qián de xiǎo dì tǎn shàng, ná qǐ le zuó wǎn nà wèi kè rén yí wàng de shǒu zhàng.
我站在壁炉前的小地毯上，拿起了昨晚那位客人遗忘的手杖。
It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a "Penang lawyer."
This is one very exquisite and heavy cane, top-end has bump; this kind wood produced at Penang, called Penang patterned wood.
Zhè shì yī gēn hěn jīng zhì ér yòu chén zhòng de shǒu zhàng, dǐng duān yǒu gè gē da; zhè zhǒng mù liào chǎn yú bīn láng yǔ, míng jiào bīn láng zǐ mù.
这是一根很精致而又沉重的手杖，顶端有个疙疸；这种木料产于槟榔屿，名叫槟榔子木。
Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across.
Next-to top-end below is one circle very wide silver hoop, width about one inch.
Jǐn kào dǐng duān de xià miàn shì yī quān hěn kuān de yín gū, kuān dù yuē yǒu yī yīng cùn.
紧挨顶端的下面是一圈很宽的银箍，宽度约有一英寸。
"To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.," was engraved upon it, with the date "1884."
On engraved "give to Royal Surgery Medical College bachelor James Mortimer, C.C.H. friends presented", also engraved "1884 year".
Shàng kè "sòng gěi huáng jiā wài kē yī xué yuàn xué shì jié mǔ shì · mó tí mò, C.C.H. de péng yǒu men zèng", hái kè yǒu "yī bā bā sì nián".
上刻"送给皇家外科医学院学士杰姆士·摩梯末，Ｃ．Ｃ．Ｈ．的朋友们赠"，还刻有"一八八四年"。
It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified, solid, and reassuring.
This merely is one old-style private doctor commonly used that kind both dignified, sturdy and practical cane.
Zhè bù guò shì yī gēn jiù shì de sī rén yī shēng suǒ cháng yòng de nà zhǒng jì zhuāng zhòng, jiān gù ér yòu shí yòng de shǒu zhàng.
这不过是一根旧式的私人医生所常用的那种既庄重、坚固而又实用的手杖。
"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"
"Ah, Watson, you to it what view?"
"A, huá shēng, nǐ duì tā de kàn fǎ zěn me yàng?"
"啊，华生，你对它的看法怎么样？"
Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation.
Holmes right back toward me sat there, I originally thought I playing with cane thing did not make him notice.
Fú ěr mó sī zhèng bèi duì zhe wǒ zuò zài nà lǐ, wǒ yuán yǐ wéi wǒ bǎi nòng shǒu zhàng de shì bìng méi yǒu jiào tā fā jué ne.
福尔摩斯正背对着我坐在那里，我原以为我摆弄手杖的事并没有叫他发觉呢。
"How did you know what I was doing?
"How you know I doing what?
"Nǐ zěn me zhī dào wǒ zài gàn shén me ne?
"你怎么知道我在干什么呢？
I believe you have eyes in the back of your head."
I think your back of head on certainly grown eyes."
Wǒ xiǎng nǐ de hòu nǎo ké er shàng yī dìng zhǎng le yǎn jīng le ba."
我想你的后脑勺儿上一定长了眼睛了吧。"
"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me," said he. "But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's stick?
"At least my in front placed one polished very bright silver-plated coffee pot." he said, "But, Watson, tell me, you to our this guest's cane what view?
"Zhì shǎo wǒ de yǎn qián fàng zhe yī bǎ cā dé hěn liàng de dù yín kā fēi hú." Tā shuō, "kě shì, huá shēng, gào sù wǒ, nǐ duì zán men zhè wèi kè rén de shǒu zhàng zěn yàng kàn ne?"
"至少我的眼前放着一把擦得很亮的镀银咖啡壶。" 我想你的后脑勺儿上一定长了眼睛了吧。"
Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.
Regrettable is we did not meet him, to him this coming purpose also completely unknown, therefore, this unexpected memento then becomes more important.
Yí hàn de shì zán men méi yǒu yù dào tā, duì tā cǐ lái de mù dì yě yī wú suǒ zhī, yīn cǐ, zhè jiàn yì wài de jì niàn pǐn jiù biàn dé gèng zhòng yào le.
遗憾的是咱们没有遇到他，对他此来的目的也一无所知，因此，这件意外的纪念品就变得更重要了。
Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it."
After you carefully examine it, describe this person to me."
Zài nǐ bǎ tā zǐ xì dì chá kàn guò yǐ hòu, bǎ zhè gè rén gěi wǒ xíng róng yī fān ba."
在你把它仔细地察看过以后，把这个人给我形容一番吧。"
"I think," said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, "that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation."
"I think," I as much as possible used my this partner's reasoning method said, "from knowing him people give him this used to show respect memento look, Mortimer doctor is one accomplished, older medical world person, and very respected."
"Wǒ xiǎng," wǒ jǐn liàng yán yòng zhe wǒ zhè wèi huǒ bàn de tuī lǐ fāng fǎ shuō, "cóng rèn shí tā de rén men sòng gěi tā zhè jiàn yòng lái biǎo shì jìng yì de jì niàn pǐn lái kàn, mó tí mò yī shēng shì yī wèi gōng chéng míng jiù, nián suì jiào dà de yī xué jiè rén shì, bìng qiě hěn shòu rén zūn jìng."
"我想，"我尽量沿用着我这位伙伴的推理方法说，"从认识他的人们送给他这件用来表示敬意的纪念品来看，摩梯末医生是一位功成名就、年岁较大的医学界人士，并且很受人尊敬。"
"Good!" said Holmes. "Excellent!"
"Good!" Holmes said: "Excellent!"
"Hǎo wa!" Fú ěr mó sī shuō:"hǎo jí le!"
"好哇！" 至少我的眼前放着一把擦得很亮的镀银咖啡壶。" 我想你的后脑勺儿上一定长了眼睛了吧。"
"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot."
"I also think, he very possibly is one in countryside practice doctor, house calls mostly on foot."
"Wǒ hái rèn wéi, tā hěn kě néng shì yī wèi zài xiāng cūn xíng yī de yī shēng, chū zhěn shí duō bàn shì bù xíng de."
"我还认为，他很可能是一位在乡村行医的医生，出诊时多半是步行的。"
"Why so?"
"Why?"
"Wèi shén me ne?"
"为什么呢？"
"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
"Because this cane originally although very beautiful, but, already bumped very badly, very hard to imagine one in city practice doctor still willing to hold it.
"Yīn wèi zhè gēn shǒu zhàng yuán lái suī hěn piào liàng, kě shì, yǐ jīng kē pèng dé hěn lì hài le, hěn nán xiǎng xiàng yī wèi zài chéng lǐ xíng yī de yī shēng hái kěn ná zhe tā.
"因为这根手杖原来虽很漂亮，可是，已经磕碰得很厉害了，很难想象一位在城里行医的医生还肯拿着它。
The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it."
Lower end fitted thick iron ferrule already worn very badly, therefore, obviously he used it walked a lot of road."
Xià duān suǒ zhuāng de hòu tiě bāo tóu yǐ jīng mó sǔn dé hěn lì hài le, yīn cǐ, xiǎn rán tā céng yòng tā zǒu guò hěn duō de lù."
下端所装的厚铁包头已经磨损得很厉害了，因此，显然他曾用它走过很多的路。"
"Perfectly sound!" said Holmes.
"Completely correct!" Holmes said.
"Wán quán zhèng què!" "Wán quán zhèng què!"
"完全正确！" 我还认为，他很可能是一位在乡村行医的医生，出诊时多半是步行的。"
"And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return."
"Also, on engraved 'C.C.H. friends', according to my guess, most likely refers to one hunters club [because hunter (Hunter) word's first letter is H, so Watson guessed C.C.H. possibly is one what hunters club organization name's abbreviation.——translator's note]; he possibly once gave local this hunters club members done some surgical treatment, therefore, they then gave him this small gift to show thanks."
"Hái yǒu, nà shàng miàn kè zhe 'C.C.H. De péng yǒu men', jù wǒ cāi xiǎng, suǒ zhǐ de dà gài shì gè liè rén huì[yīn wèi liè rén (Hunter) Yī cí de tóu yī gè zì mǔ shì H, suǒ yǐ huá shēng tuī xiǎng C.C.H. Kě néng shì gè shén me liè rén huì zǔ zhī míng chēng de suō xiě zì.——yì zhě zhù]; tā kě néng céng jīng gěi dāng dì de zhè gè liè rén huì de huì yuán men zuò guò yī xiē wài kē zhì liáo, yīn cǐ, tā men cái sòng le tā zhè jiàn xiǎo lǐ wù biǎo shì chóu xiè."
"还有，那上面刻着'Ｃ．Ｃ．Ｈ．的朋友们'，据我猜想，所指的大概是个猎人会［因为猎人（Ｈｕｎｔｅｒ）一词的头一个字母是Ｈ，所以华生推想Ｃ．Ｃ．Ｈ．可能是个什么猎人会组织名称的缩写字。 因此，显然他曾用它走过很多的路。"
"Really, Watson, you excel yourself," said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. "I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities.
"Watson, you really made great progress," Holmes while saying, while chair pushed back a bit and lit CopyRScontinue.a cigarette, "I cannot not say, in you enthusiastically for me those small achievements made all records inside, you already accustomed to underestimate your ability.
"Huá shēng, nǐ zhēn shì dà yǒu zhǎng jìn le," fú ěr mó sī yī miàn shuō zhe, yī miàn bǎ yǐ zǐ xiàng hòu tuī le tuī, bìng diǎn le zhī zhǐ yān, "wǒ bù néng bù shuō, zài nǐ rè xīn dì wèi wǒ nà xiē wēi xiǎo de chéng jiù suǒ zuò de yī qiē jì zǎi lǐ miàn, nǐ yǐ jīng xí guàn yú dī gū zì jǐ de néng lì le.
"华生，你真是大有长进了，"福尔摩斯一面说着，一面把椅子向后推了推，并点了支纸烟，"我不能不说，在你热心地为我那些微小的成就所作的一切记载里面，你已经习惯于低估自己的能力了。
It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light.
Maybe you yourself cannot shine, but, you are light's conductor.
Yě xǔ nǐ běn shēn bìng bù néng fā guāng, dàn shì, nǐ shì guāng de chuán dǎo zhě.
也许你本身并不能发光，但是，你是光的传导者。
Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it.
Some people themselves have no talent, but have considerable stimulate talent power.
Yǒu xiē rén běn shēn méi yǒu tiān cái, kě shì yǒu zhe kě guān de jī fā tiān cái de lì liàng.
有些人本身没有天才，可是有着可观的激发天才的力量。
I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt."
I admit, dear partner, I really too grateful to you."
Wǒ chéng rèn, qīn ài de huǒ bàn, wǒ zhēn shì tài gǎn jī nǐ le."
我承认，亲爱的伙伴，我真是太感激你了。"
He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods.
He previously never spoke so many words, undeniable, his words gave me great joy. Because in past he to my admiration for him and effort to make his reasoning method public often showed indifferent attitude, this very hurt my self-esteem.
Tā yǐ qián cóng lái méi yǒu jiǎng guò zhè me duō de huà, bù kě fǒu rèn, tā de huà gěi le wǒ jí dà de kuài lè.   Wǒ chéng rèn, qīn ài de huǒ bàn, wǒ zhēn shì tài gǎn jī nǐ le."
他以前从来没有讲过这么多的话，不可否认，他的话给了我极大的快乐。  我承认，亲爱的伙伴，我真是太感激你了。"
I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval.
And now I actually also can master his method, and practically applied it, also got his approval, thinking about this point I then felt very proud.
Ér xiàn zài wǒ jū rán yě néng zhǎng wò le tā de fāng fǎ, bìng qiě shí jì yīng yòng qǐ lái, hái dé dào le tā de zàn xǔ, xiǎng qǐ zhè diǎn wǒ jiù gǎn dào hěn jiāo ào.
而现在我居然也能掌握了他的方法，并且实际应用起来，还得到了他的赞许，想起这点我就感到很骄傲。
He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.
He from my hand took the cane, used eyes examined a few minutes, then with a very interested expression put down cigarette, brought cane to window and used magnifying glass carefully examined.
Xiàn zài tā cóng wǒ shǒu zhōng bǎ shǒu zhàng ná le guò qù, yòng yǎn jīng shěn shì le jǐ fèn zhōng, rán hòu dài zhe yī fù hěn gǎn xìng qù de shén qíng fàng xià le zhǐ yān, bǎ shǒu zhàng ná dào chuāng qián yòu yòng fàng dà jìng zǐ xì chá kàn qǐ lái.
现在他从我手中把手杖拿了过去，用眼睛审视了几分钟，然后带着一副很感兴趣的神情放下了纸烟，把手杖拿到窗前又用放大镜仔细察看起来。
"Interesting, though elementary," said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. "There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick.
"Although very simple, but interesting," he while saying already again in his most favorite long bench one end sat down, "cane on indeed has one or two places can explain problem.
"Suī hěn jiǎn dān, dàn hái yǒu qù," tā shuō zhe jiù chóng xīn zài tā suǒ zuì xǐ huān de nà zhī cháng yǐ de yī duān zuò xià le, "shǒu zhàng shàng què shí yǒu yī liǎng chù néng gòu shuō míng wèn tí.
"虽很简单，但还有趣，"他说着就重新在他所最喜欢的那只长椅的一端坐下了，"手杖上确实有一两处能够说明问题。
It gives us the basis for several deductions."
It to our reasoning provided basis."
Tā gěi wǒ men de tuī lùn tí gòng le gēn jù."
它给我们的推论提供了根据。"
"Has anything escaped me?"
"I still missed something?"
"Wǒ hái lòu diào le shén me dōng xī ma?"
"我还漏掉了什么东西吗？"
I asked with some self-importance. "I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?"
I somewhat conceitedly asked, "I believe I did not overlook important place."
Wǒ yǒu xiē zì fù dì wèn dào, "wǒ xiāng xìn wǒ méi yǒu bǎ zhòng dà de dì fāng hū lüè diào."
我有些自负地问道，"我相信我没有把重大的地方忽略掉。"
"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous.
"Dear Watson, afraid your conclusions most are wrong!
"Qīn ài de huá shēng, kǒng pà nǐ de jié lùn dà bù fèn dōu shì cuò wù de ne!
"亲爱的华生，恐怕你的结论大部分都是错误的呢！
When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.
Frankly speaking, when I said you stimulated me, my meaning is: while I point out your errors, often then lead me to truth.
Tǎn bái dì shuō ba, dāng wǒ shuō nǐ jī fā le wǒ de shí hòu, wǒ de yì sī shì shuō:Zài wǒ zhǐ chū nǐ mí wù zhī chù de tóng shí, wǎng wǎng jiù bǎ wǒ yǐn xiàng le zhēn lǐ.
坦白地说吧，当我说你激发了我的时候，我的意思是说：在我指出你谬误之处的同时，往往就把我引向了真理。
Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance.
But not saying this time you completely wrong.
Dàn bìng bú shì shuō zhè yī cì nǐ wán quán cuò wù le.
但并不是说这一次你完全错误了。
The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal."
That person certainly is one in countryside practice doctor, and he indeed often on foot."
Nà gè rén kěn dìng shì yī wèi zài xiāng cūn xíng yī de yī shēng, ér qiě tā què shì cháng cháng bù xíng de."
那个人肯定是一位在乡村行医的医生，而且他确是常常步行的。"
"Then I was right."
"So, my guess is correct."
"Nà me shuō, wǒ de cāi cè jiù shì duì de le."
"那么说，我的猜测就是对的了。"
"To that extent."
"Also only to this extent only."
"Yě zhǐ shì dào zhè gè chéng dù ér yǐ."
"也只是到这个程度而已。"
"But that was all."
"But, that is all facts."
"Dàn shì, nà jiù shì quán bù shì shí le."
"但是，那就是全部事实了。"
"No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all.
"No, no, dear Watson, not all—not all.
"Bù, bù, qīn ài de huá shēng, bìng fēi quán bù——jué bú shì quán bù.
"不，不，亲爱的华生，并非全部——决不是全部。
I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest themselves."
For example, I would like to propose, give this doctor this gift, rather than say from hunters club, rather say from one hospital; because two initials 'C.C.' placed in 'hospital' word (in English, hospital word's initial also H) before. Therefore, very naturally make people think of Charing Cross these two words."
Bǐ rú shuō, wǒ dǎo yuàn yì tí chū, sòng gěi zhè wèi yī shēng de zhè jiàn lǐ wù, yǔ qí shuō shì lái zì liè rén huì, dǎo bú rú shuō shì lái zì yī jiā yī yuàn; yóu yú liǎng gè zì tóu 'C.C.'

譬如说，我倒愿意提出，送给这位医生的这件礼物，与其说是来自猎人会，倒不如说是来自一家医院；由于两个字头'Ｃ．Ｃ．'是放在'医院'一词（在英文中，医院一词的字头也是Ｈ）之前的。 "但是，那就是全部事实了。"
"You may be right."
"Maybe you right."
"Yě xǔ shì nǐ duì le."
"也许是你对了。"
"The probability lies in that direction.
"Very possibly like this.
"Hěn kě néng shì zhè yàng de.
"很可能是这样的。
And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor."
If we take this point as valid assumption, then we again have one new basis. From this basis starting, can to this unknown visitor make portrayal."
Rú guǒ zán men ná zhè yī diǎn dāng zuò yǒu xiào de jiǎ shè de huà, nà wǒ men jiù yòu yǒu le yī gè xīn de gēn jù le. Yīn cǐ, hěn zì rán de shǐ rén xiǎng qǐ le Charing Cross zhè liǎng gè zì lái."
如果咱们拿这一点当作有效的假设的话，那我们就又有了一个新的根据了。 因此，很自然的使人想起了ＣｈａｒｉｎｇＣｒｏｓｓ这两个字来。"
"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?"
"Good! Suppose 'C.C.H.' refers to Charing Cross Hospital, then we ultimately can draw what further conclusion?"
"Hǎo ba! Yě xǔ shì nǐ duì le."
"好吧！ "也许是你对了。"
"Do none suggest themselves?
"Isn't there a bit can explain problem place?
"Nán dào jiù méi yǒu yī diǎn néng gòu shuō míng wèn tí de dì fāng le ma?
"难道就没有一点能够说明问题的地方了吗？
You know my methods. Apply them!"
Since understand my method, then use it!"
Jì rán dǒng dé le wǒ de fāng fǎ, nà me jiù yīng yòng ba!"
既然懂得了我的方法，那么就应用吧！"
"I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country."
"I only can think of one obvious conclusion, that person in going countryside before once in city practiced."
"Wǒ zhǐ néng xiǎng chū yī gè míng xiǎn de jié lùn lái, nà gè rén CopyRScontinuezài xià xiāng zhī qián céng zài chéng lǐ xíng guò yī."
我只能想出一个明显的结论来，那个人在下乡之前曾在城里行过医。"
"I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made?
"I think we can boldly than this further, from this angle looking, most possibly in what kind of situation, can happen such gift giving action?
"Wǒ xiǎng zán men kě yǐ dà dǎn dì bǐ zhè gèng qián jìn yī bù, cóng zhè yàng de jiǎo dù lái kàn, zuì kě néng shì zài shén me yàng de qíng kuàng xià, cái huì fā shēng zhè yàng de zèng lǐ de xíng dòng ne?
"我想咱们可以大胆地比这更前进一步，从这样的角度来看，最可能是在什么样的情况下，才会发生这样的赠礼的行动呢？
When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will?
When, his friends would unite to show their goodwill?
Zài shén me shí hòu, tā de péng yǒu men cái huì lián hé qǐ lái xiàng tā biǎo shì tā men de hǎo yì ne?
在什么时候，他的朋友们才会联合起来向他表示他们的好意呢？
Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice for himself.
Obviously is in Mortimer for self-practice leaving hospital time.
Xiǎn rán shì zài mó tí mò wèi le zì xíng kāi yè ér lí kāi yī yuàn de shí hòu.
显然是在摩梯末为了自行开业而离开医院的时候。
We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice.
We know had one gift giving thing; we believe he once from one city hospital transferred to countryside to practice.
Wǒ men zhī dào yǒu guò yī cì zèng lǐ de shì; wǒ men xiāng xìn tā céng cóng yī jiā chéng shì yī yuàn zhuǎn dào xiāng cūn qù xíng yī.
我们知道有过一次赠礼的事；我们相信他曾从一家城市医院转到乡村去行医。
Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?"
Then we conclude, say this gift in this transfer time given not considered excessive."
Nà me zán men xià jié lùn, shuō zhè lǐ wù shì zài zhè gè zhuǎn huàn de dāng er sòng de bú suàn guò fèn ba."
那么咱们下结论，说这礼物是在这个转换的当儿送的不算过分吧。"
"It certainly seems probable."
"Seems certainly possible."
"Kàn lái dāng rán shì kě néng de."
"看来当然是可能的。"
"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.
"Now, you can see, he wouldn't be chief physician, because only when one person in London practiced already had considerable reputation, can hold such position, and such person then wouldn't move to countryside.
"Xiàn zài, nǐ kě yǐ kàn dé chū lái, tā bú huì shì zhǔ yào yī shī, yīn wèi zhǐ yǒu dāng yī gè rén zài lún dūn xíng yī yǐ yǒu le xiāng dāng míng wàng de shí hòu, cái néng jù yǒu zhè yàng de dì wèi, ér zhè yàng de yī gè rén jiù bú huì qiān wǎng xiāng cūn qù le.
"现在，你可以看得出来，他不会是主要医师，因为只有当一个人在伦敦行医已有了相当名望的时候，才能据有这样的地位，而这样的一个人就不会迁往乡村去了。
What was he, then?
Then, he ultimately is doing what?
Nà me, tā jiū jìng shì gè zuò shén me de ne?
那么，他究竟是个做什么的呢？
If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more than a senior student. And he left five years ago--the date is on the stick.
If say he in hospital worked but not considered chief physician, then he only possibly is one house surgeon or house physician—position slightly higher than medical school's senior student; and he five years ago left—date engraved on cane, therefore your that solemn, middle-aged doctor then evaporated.
Rú guǒ shuō tā shì zài yī yuàn lǐ gōng zuò ér yòu bú suàn zài zhǔ yào yī shī zhī liè, nà me tā jiù zhǐ kě néng shì gè zhù yuàn wài kē yī shēng huò zhě shì zhù yuàn nèi kē yī shēng——dì wèi shāo shāo gāo yú yī xué yuàn zuì gāo nián jí de xué shēng; ér tā shì zài wǔ nián yǐ qián lí kāi de——rì qī shì kè zài shǒu zhàng shàng de, yīn cǐ nǐ de nà wèi yán sù de, zhōng nián de yī shēng jiù huà wéi wū yǒu le.
如果说他是在医院里工作而又不算在主要医师之列，那么他就只可能是个住院外科医生或者是住院内科医生——地位稍稍高于医学院最高年级的学生；而他是在五年以前离开的——日期是刻在手杖上的，因此你的那位严肃的、中年的医生就化为乌有了。
So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff."
