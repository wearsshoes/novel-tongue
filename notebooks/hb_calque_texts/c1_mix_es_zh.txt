Chapter one
Sherlock Holmes Mr.
Sherlock Holmes Mr. sat at table breakfast, he except often all-night not sleep besides, morning always was get-up very late. I stood at fireplace front small rug on, picked up last night that guest forgot cane. This is one very exquisite and heavy cane, top-end has bump; this kind wood produced at Penang, called Penang patterned wood. Next-to top-end below is one circle very wide silver hoop, width about one inch. On engraved "give to Royal Surgery Medical College bachelor James Mortimer, C.C.H. friends presented", also engraved "1884 year". This merely is one old-style private doctor commonly used that kind both dignified, sturdy and practical cane.
"Ah, Watson, you to it what view?"
Holmes right back toward me sat there, I originally thought I playing with cane thing did not make him notice.
"How you know I doing what? I think your back of head on certainly grown eyes."
"At least my in front placed one polished very bright silver-plated coffee pot." he said, "But, Watson, tell me, you to our this guest's cane what view? Regrettable is we did not meet him, to him this coming purpose also completely unknown, therefore, this unexpected memento then becomes more important. After you carefully examine it, describe this person to me."
"I think," I as much as possible used my this partner's reasoning method said, "from knowing him people give him this used to show respect memento look, Mortimer doctor is one accomplished, older medical world person, and very respected."
"Good!" Holmes said: "Excellent!"
"I also think, he very possibly is one in countryside practice doctor, house calls mostly on foot."
"Why?"
"Because this cane originally although very beautiful, but, already bumped very badly, very hard to imagine one in city practice doctor still willing to hold it. Lower end fitted thick iron ferrule already worn very badly, therefore, obviously he used it walked a lot of road."
"Completely correct!" Holmes said.
"Also, on engraved 'C.C.H. friends', according to my guess, most likely refers to one hunters club [because hunter (Hunter) word's first letter is H, so Watson guessed C.C.H. possibly is one what hunters club organization name's abbreviation.——translator's note]; he possibly once gave local this hunters club members done some surgical treatment, therefore, they then gave him this small gift to show thanks."
"Watson, you really made great progress," Holmes while saying, while chair pushed back a bit and lit a cigarette, "I cannot not say, in you enthusiastically for me those small achievements made all records inside, you already accustomed to underestimate your ability. Maybe you yourself cannot shine, but, you are light's conductor. Some people themselves have no talent, but have considerable stimulate talent power. I admit, dear partner, I really too grateful to you."
He previously never spoke so many words, undeniable, his words gave me great joy. Because in past he to my admiration for him and effort to make his reasoning method public often showed indifferent attitude, this very hurt my self-esteem. And now I actually also can master his method, and practically applied it, also got his approval, thinking about this point I then felt very proud. Now he from my hand took the cane, used eyes examined a few minutes, then with a very interested expression put down cigarette, brought cane to window and used magnifying glass carefully examined.
"Although very simple, but interesting," he while saying already again in his most favorite long bench one end sat down, "cane on indeed has one or two places can explain problem. It to our reasoning provided basis."
"I still missed something?" I somewhat conceitedly asked, "I believe I did not overlook important place."
"Dear Watson, afraid your conclusions most are wrong! Frankly speaking, when I said you stimulated me, my meaning is: while I point out your errors, often then lead me to truth. But not saying this time you completely wrong. That person certainly is one in countryside practice doctor, and he indeed often on foot."
"So, my guess is correct."
"Also only to this extent only."
"But, that is all facts."
"No, no, dear Watson, not all—not all. For example, I would like to propose, give this doctor this gift, rather than say from hunters club, rather say from one hospital; because two initials 'C.C.' placed in 'hospital' word (in English, hospital word's initial also H) before. Therefore, very naturally make people think of Charing Cross these two words."
"Maybe you right."
"Very possibly like this. If we take this point as valid assumption, then we again have one new basis. From this basis starting, can to this unknown visitor make portrayal."
"Good! Suppose 'C.C.H.' refers to Charing Cross Hospital, then we ultimately can draw what further conclusion?"
"Isn't there a bit can explain problem place? Since understand my method, then use it!"
"I only can think of one obvious conclusion, that person in going countryside before once in city practiced."
"I think we can boldly than this further, from this angle looking, most possibly in what kind of situation, can happen such gift giving action? When, his friends would unite to show their goodwill? Obviously is in Mortimer for self-practice leaving hospital time. We know had one gift giving thing; we believe he once from one city hospital transferred to countryside to practice. Then we conclude, say this gift in this transfer time given not considered excessive."
"Seems certainly possible."
"Now, you can see, he wouldn't be chief physician, because only when one person in London practiced already had considerable reputation, can hold such position, and such person then wouldn't move to countryside. Then, he ultimately is doing what? If say he in hospital worked but not considered chief physician, then he only possibly is one house surgeon or house physician—position slightly higher than medical school's senior student; and he five years ago left—date engraved on cane, therefore your that solemn, middle-aged doctor then evaporated. Dear Watson, but here appeared one young man, less than thirty years old, amiable, contented, careless, he also has one beloved dog, I can roughly describe it as larger than terrier, smaller than mastiff."
I incredulously laughed. Sherlock Holmes leaned back on bench, toward ceiling blowing drifting small smoke rings.
"As for latter part, I cannot check you whether correct," I said, "but to find out several about his age and resume characteristics, at least is not very difficult." I from my that small medical books bookshelf took down one medical directory, turned to names section place. Inside had several named Mortimer, but only one possibly is our visitor. I loudly read out this record:
"James Mortimer, 1882 year graduated from Royal College of Surgeons, Devon Dartmoor Greenbow person. 1882 to 1884 years in Charing Cross Hospital served as house surgeon. For writing 'Whether Diseases Skip Generations' obtained Jackson Comparative Pathology Prize. Swedish Pathological Society corresponding member. Once wrote 'Several Generations Skipped Deformities' (published in 1882 year's 'The Lancet'), ['The Lancet' (original text Lance) is one British medical journal, still continues publishing to this day.——translator's note] 'Are We Progressing?' (published in 1883 year March 'Journal of Psychology'). Once served as Greenbow, Sothley and High Tor villages etc. parishes' medical officer."
"Did not mention that local hunters club, Watson!" Holmes with mocking smile said, "Just like you said observation results, he but is one countryside doctor; I feel my reasoning is very correct. As for those adjectives, if I remember correctly, I said 'amiable, contented and careless'. Based on my experience, in this world only kind people can receive mementos; only unambitious people can abandon London life and go to countryside; only careless people would in your room waited one hour without leaving their card, instead left their cane."
"That dog?"
"Often is carrying this cane following its owner behind. Because this wooden cane very heavy, dog had to tightly bite its middle, therefore, its teeth marks can be seen very clearly. From these teeth marks gaps, I think this dog's jaw should be wider than terrier jaw, and narrower than mastiff jaw. It possibly is...right, it certainly is one curly-haired spaniel."
He stood up, while saying while in room pacing. He in window protruding ledge front stood. His tone full of confidence, made me lift head, with surprised eyes looked at him.
"Dear partner, to this point, how you can so certainly?"
"Reason very simple, I now already see that dog in our doorsteps on, and its owner ringing bell sound also transmitted up. Don't move, I implore you, Watson. He is your colleague, you present to me maybe helpful. Watson, now really fate's most dramatic moment, you hear stair footsteps, he is walking into your life; but, you still don't know is fortune or disaster. This medical person, James Mortimer doctor wants to seek advice from crime expert Sherlock Holmes what matter? Please come in!"
This visitor's appearance, to me really is worth amazing thing, because I previously expected is one typical countryside doctor, but he is one tall and thin person, long nose like bird's beak, protruding between a pair of sharp gray eyes, two eyes close together, behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses shining. He wore is he this profession people often love to wear clothes, but rather shabby, because his overcoat already dirty, trousers also worn. Although still young, but long back already bent, he walking time head forward leaning, and has noble kind demeanor. He once came in, eyes immediately fell on Holmes holding cane on, he exclaimed ran over. "I too happy!" he said, "I cannot sure ultimately left it here? Still left in shipping company. I rather lose whole world, also not willing lose this cane."
"I think it is one gift." Holmes said.
"Yes, sir."
"Is Charing Cross Hospital gave?"
"Is there two friends when I got married gave."
"Oh! Heaven, really bad!" Holmes shaking head said.
Mortimer doctor through glasses slightly surprisedly blinked.
"Why bad?"
"Because you already disrupted our several small reasonings. You said when got married, right?"
"Yes, sir, I got married then left hospital, also gave up becoming consultant all hope. But, in order to can establish own family, doing so is completely necessary."
"Aha! We at least not wrong." Holmes said, "Well, James Mortimer doctor..."
"You call me sir enough, I am one humble Royal College of Surgeons student."
"And obviously, still one meticulous thinker."
"One to science know a little person, Holmes sir; one on vast unknown ocean shore picking up shells person. I think I am speaking to Sherlock Holmes sir, not..."
"No, this is my friend Watson doctor."
"Very glad to meet you, sir. I have heard people put you and your friend's name mentioned together. You make me very interested, Holmes sir. I really did not expect to see such long skull or such deeply sunken eye sockets. You don't mind I with hand along your skull suture touch a bit, sir? Without obtaining your this skull real thing before, if according to your skull made model, to any anthropology museum would be one excellent specimen. I don't want to be annoying, but I admit, I really envy your skull."
Sherlock Holmes gestured invited our strange guest to sit on chair. "Sir, I can see, you and I alike, is very enthusiastic about thinking own profession problems person, just like me to my profession same." he said, "I from your index finger can see you are yourself rolling cigarette smoking; don't hesitate, please light one."
That person took out cigarette paper and tobacco, in hand with amazing skill rolled one. His long fingers trembling, like insect's antennae same.
Holmes very calm, but his rapidly moving eyes made me see, he already to our this strange guest aroused interest.
"I think, sir," he finally spoke, "you last night visit, today again come, afraid not just for studying my skull, right?"
"No, sir, not, although I also very happy have opportunity to do so. I therefore come to find you, Holmes sir, because I know I myself is one lack practical experience person, and I suddenly encountered one most serious and extremely special problem. Because I certainly know you are Europe's second most brilliant expert..."
"Oh, sir! May I ask, honored to stand in first place is who?" Holmes somewhat acerbically asked.
"To one possessing precise scientific mind person say, Bertillon sir handling cases method always has very strong appeal."
"Then you go to find him consult not better?"
"Sir, I mean, to possessing precise scientific mind person say. But, to things' practical experience say, universally known, you are unique. Things I believe, sir, I did not inadvertently..."
"Just slightly a bit only," Holmes said, "I think, Mortimer doctor, better please you immediately bring requesting me assist matter clearly tell me."
