The idea for this story to me provided-my my friend, the Mr. Fletcher Robinson, who me has helped besides in the line plot and in the details of setting.

CHAPTER ONE
THE MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES
The Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who of usual got up very late, except in the occasions nothing infrequent in which not he went to bed in all the night, was breakfasting. I, who me found of foot next to the fireplace, me bent to pick up the cane forgotten by our visitor of the night previous. Solid, of wood of good quality and with a bulge to manner of handle, it was of the type that is known as “lawyer of Penang.” Immediately below of the protuberance the cane carried a wide strip of silver, of more than two centimeters, in the which was engraved “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., of his friends of C.C.H.,” and the year, “1884.” It was exactly the kind of cane that used to carry the doctors of primary care to the old fashion: dignified, solid, and that inspired confidence.
-Let's see, Watson, to what conclusions arrive-you?
-How knows-you what am doing-I? Am going to believe that has-you eyes in the nape.
-What have-I, more rather, is a shiny coffee pot with bath of silver in front of me -me answered-he-. Come on, Watson, tell-me what think-you of the cane of our visitor. Since we have had the misfortune of not coincide with him and ignore what was what wanted-he, this memory fortuitous acquires importance. Describe-me to the owner with the data that have provided-you the examination of the cane.
-Seems to me -said-I, following until where was possible the methods of my companion- that the doctor Mortimer is a doctor entered in years and prestigious who enjoys of general esteem, since those who know him have given him this show of their appreciation.
-Well! -said Holmes-. Excellent!
-Also seems to me very probable that is-he doctor rural and that make on foot many of his visits.
-Why says-you that?
-Because this cane, despite its excellent quality, is so battered that hardly imagine-I to a doctor of city carrying-it. The thick ferrule of iron is very worn, for which is evident that its owner has walked a lot with it.
-A reasoning perfect! -said Holmes.
-And besides not there is to forget of the “friends of C.C.H.” Imagine-I that treats-itself of a association local of hunters, to whose members is possible that has attended professionally and that have offered to him in reward this small gift.
-To say truth has exceeded-you yourself to yourself -said Holmes, moving the chair from the table of the breakfast and lighting a cigarette-. See-I obligated to confess that, of usual, in the stories with which has had-you to well collect my modest successes, always has underestimated-you your skill personal. Is possible that you yourself not be luminous, but without doubt is a good conductor of the light. There are people that without being geniuses possess a remarkable power of stimulus. Have to recognize, my dear friend, that am very in debt with you.
Until then Holmes not had shown never so praiseworthy, and must recognize that his words me produced a satisfaction very intense, because the indifference with that received my admiration and my attempts of give publicity to his methods me had hurt in many occasions. Also me proud thought that had arrived to master his system enough as to apply-it of a form able of deserve his approval. Act followed Holmes took possession of the cane and examined-it during some minutes. Then, as if something had awakened especially his interest, left the cigarette and moved with the cane next to the window, to examine-it again with a lens convex.
-Interesting, although elementary -said, while returned to his place preferred in the sofa-. There are without doubt one or two indications in the cane that serve of base for several deductions.
-Has escaped-me something? -asked with certain presumption-. Trust-I in not have forgotten nothing important.
-Fear-I a lot, my dear Watson, that almost all your conclusions are false. When have said that has served-you to me of stimulus referred-I, if have to be sincere, to that your mistakes me have led in occasions to the truth. Although neither is true that has mistaken-you completely in this case. Treat-itself without doubt of a doctor rural that walks a lot.
-Then had-I reason.
-Until there, yes.
-But only until there.
-Only until there, my dear Watson; because that not is all, nor much less. I would consider more probable, for example, that a gift to a doctor proceeds from a hospital and not from a association of hunters, and that when the initials CC go united to the word hospital, occur to us immediately that treats-itself of Charing Cross.
-Perhaps have-you reason.
-The probabilities are oriented in that sense. And if adopt-we this as hypothesis of work, have-we of a new point of departure from where give shape to our unknown visitor.
-Agree; suppose that “CCH” means “Hospital of Charing Cross”; what other conclusions can take-out from there?
-Not occur-to-you some of immediate? You know my methods. Apply-them!
-Only occur-to-me the conclusion evident of that our man has exercised his profession in London before of march to the field.
-Think-I that can venture-we a little more. See-it from this perspective. In what occasion is more probable that made-a gift of those characteristics? When will have put-agreement his friends for give-him that proof of affection? Evidently in the moment in that the doctor Mortimer left of work in the hospital for open his own practice. Know-we that made-to him a gift. Believe-we that has produced-a change and that the doctor Mortimer has passed from the hospital of the city to a practice in the field. Think-you that are carrying too far our deductions if say-we that the gift made-itself with motive of that change?
-Seems probable, from then.
-Observe-you, besides, that not could form part of the staff permanent of the hospital, since only is named for those positions to professionals experienced, with a good clientele in London, and a doctor of those characteristics not would leave after to a town. What was, in that case? If worked-he in the hospital without have joined-to the staff permanent, only could be surgeon or doctor internal: little more than student postgraduate. And left five years ago; the date is in the cane. In way that his doctor of head, person serious and of middle age, disappears, my dear Watson, and appears in his place a young man that not has fulfilled still the thirties, affable, little ambitious, distracted, and owner of a dog for the that feels great affection and that describe-I approximately as bigger than a terrier but smaller than a mastiff.
I me threw to laugh with incredulity while Sherlock Holmes leaned back in the sofa and sent towards the ceiling trembling rings of smoke.
-In regarding to his last affirmations, lack-I of means for rebut-them -said-, but at least not will be difficult find some data about the age and career professional of our man.
From the modest shelf where kept the books related with the medicine took-out the directory medical and, to search for the surname, found several Mortimer, but only one that matched with our visitor, so proceeded to read in voice loud the note biographical.
“Mortimer, James, MRCS, 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devonshire. From 1882 to 1884 surgeon internal in the hospital of Charing Cross. In possession of the prize Jackson of pathology compared, thanks to the work titled ‘Is the disease a regression?’. Member correspondent of the Society Swedish of Pathology. Author of ‘Some phenomena of atavism’ (Lancet, 1882), ‘Are we progressing?’ (Journal of Psychology, March of 1883). Doctor of the municipalities of Grimpen, Thorsley and High Barrow.”
-Not is mentioned no association of hunters -commented Holmes with a smile malicious-; but yes that our visitor is doctor rural, as you deduced accurately. Think-I that my deductions are justified. In regarding to the adjectives, said-I, if not remember badly, affable, little ambitious and distracted. According to my experience, only a man affable receives gifts of his colleagues, only a man without ambitions leaves a career in London for go-se to a town and only a person distracted leaves the cane instead of the card of visit after of wait a hour.
-And the dog?
-Is accustomed to carry the cane to his owner. As is a object heavy, has that hold-it with strength by the center, and the marks of his teeth are perfectly visible. The jaw of the animal, as puts of manifest the distance between the marks, is, in my opinion, too wide for a terrier and not enough for a mastiff. Could be..., yes, clear that yes: treats-itself of a spaniel of hair curly.
Holmes had got up and walked by the room while spoke. Finally stopped next to the hollow of the window. There was a tone such of conviction in his voice that lifted the sight surprised.
-How can be-you so sure of that?
-By the simple reason of that am seeing the dog in front of our house, and just have heard how his owner has called to the door. Not move-you, beg-you. Treat-itself of one of his brothers of profession, and the presence of you can be-me of help. This is the moment dramatic of the destiny, Watson: hear-themselves in the stairs the steps of someone that is preparing-to enter in our life and not know-we if will be for good or for bad. What is what the doctor

 James Mortimer, the scientist, desires of Sherlock Holmes, the detective? Forward!
The appearance of our visitor was a surprise for me, given that expected-I to the typical doctor rural and found-I to a man very tall and thin, of nose long and hooked, shot towards forward between some eyes grey and piercing, very together, that sparkled from behind of some lenses of frame golden. Dressed according with his profession, but of way somewhat neglected, because his frock coat was dirty and the trousers, frayed. Hunched although still young, walked throwing the head towards forward and offered an air general of benevolence short of sight. Upon entering, his eyes stumbled with the cane that Holmes had between the hands, for which threw-he towards it launching a exclamation of joy.
-How glad am! -said-. Not knew if had left-it here or in the agency maritime. Would feel a lot lose that cane.
-A gift, by what see-I -said Holmes.
-So is.
-From the hospital of Charing Cross?
-From one or two friends that had there, with occasion of my marriage.
-My, my! What a setback! -said Holmes, shaking the head.
-What is the setback?
-Only that has thrown-you by earth our modest deductions. Your marriage, has said-you?
-Yes, sir. Upon marrying left-I the hospital, and with that all hope of open a practice. Needed-I a home.
-Well, well; not were-we so mistaken, after all -said Holmes-. And now, doctor James Mortimer...
-Not am doctor; only a modest MRCS.
-And person lover of the accuracy, by what see-I.
-A simple amateur to the science, sir Holmes, collector of shells in the beaches of the great ocean of the unknown. Imagine that am speaking with the Mr. Sherlock Holmes and not...
-Not is mistaken; I am Sherlock Holmes and this is my friend, the doctor Watson.
-Delighted of meet him, doctor Watson. Have heard mention his name along with the of his friend. Interests-me you a lot, sir Holmes. Not expected meet-me with a skull so dolichocephalic nor with a arch supraorbital so pronounced. Would mind-you that traced-I with the finger your fissure parietal? A mold of your skull, sir mine, until can dispose of the original, would be the pride of any museum anthropological. Not is my intention seem obsequious, but confess that covet your skull.
Sherlock Holmes made a gesture with the hand to invite to our strange visitor to that took seat. -See that excites-you so much with your ideas as I with mine -said-. And observe-I by your finger index that makes-you yourself the cigarettes. Not doubt in light one if so desire.
The doctor Mortimer took-out paper and tobacco and rolled a cigarette with surprising dexterity. His fingers, long and trembling, were so agile and restless as the antennae of a insect.
Holmes kept silent, but the intensity of his attention me demonstrated the interest that awakened in him our curious visitor.
-Suppose-I -said finally-, that not owe-we the honor of your visit of last night and this of today exclusively to your desire of examine my skull.
-No, clear is; although also me glad of have had the opportunity of do it, have come to you, sir Holmes, because not is hidden to me that am a person little practical and because me face suddenly with a problem so serious as singular. And recognizing, as I recognize, that is-you the second expert European better qualified...
-Ah. Can ask-to you to who corresponds the honor of be the first? -interrupted Holmes with some asperity.
-For a person lover of the accuracy and of the science, the work of monsieur Bertillon will have always a powerful attraction.
-Not would be better consult him to him in that case?
-Have spoken of people lovers of the accuracy and of the science. But in regarding to sense practical all the world recognizes that lacks-you of rival. Hope, sir mine, not have...
-Only a little -said Holmes-. Not will be of more, doctor Mortimer, that, without more preamble, have the kindness of tell-me in few words what is exactly the problem for whose resolution requests-you my help.
